NOTES:

Double check:
- contact form
- on iphone 5 is the screen is scrollable left to right? needs max width on mobile?


TO DO !important:
- contact thanks page has contact form on for some reason 
- fix gaps when headings aren't chosen to be filled in
- around width 1160 the navbar text is set to shrink quite small for such a size. add another breakpoint?
- mobile nav li's onto two lines on iphone 5
- decide on design conventions e.g. when textboxes are used, when headings
- on tiny mobile there should be less padding (so content is wider)
- tried to make phone size text less wide but now not enough side padding on big screens
- FAVICON doesn't work - Charlotte's does - currently still drupal (in browser back button dropdown)

TO DO not important:
- edit globe continents and edit speech image colours
- image on about page could be wider on mobile
- check all fonts are nice, especially main title logo font
- change two columns to multiple columns of at least 3-4?
- make short text row (1-3 lines) and (4+ lines text row) or swap to using Foundation 6 grid?
- fix footer on some pages ( actually only an issue when not enough content so should be ok)
- google analytics - php option - is working?
- 404 page
- google preview


DONE:
- htc access - for redirects e.g. about to about/liz
- for a news section, I at the moment only have one entry template
- there is an issue with the 4 image boxes on home page where the fourth one drops down low when page is certain widths
- remove body section from homepage or make it slimmer
- add proper contact form?
- replace placeholder text
- fix hyperlinks showing as white
- Final li of mobile nav needs same margin as rest
- tiny mobile nav, Liz menu is too much to left
- top margins on mobile nav could be better
- return all colours to normal
- mobile nav is salmon, desktop is plain red:
nav {
    position: fixed;
    top: 0px;
    bottom: 0px;
    left: 0px;
    width: 260px;
    max-height: none;
    background-color: #C8233F;
    padding: 20px 15px;
    border-right: 4px;
    border-color: white;
    border-style: double;
    border-left: none;
    border-top: none;
    border-bottom: none;
}
- sending an email goes to 404 because there is no page http://www.lizdeanconsultancy.co.uk/index.php/contact/thanks
- urls are too long for mobile, not wrapping
- centering main nav title
- closing x is not in viewport, but to the right
- iphone issues: LIZ DEAN navbar text goes onto two lines
