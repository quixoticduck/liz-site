NOTES:

Double check:
-contact form

TO DO:
on my mobile the screen is scrollable left to right. needs max width on mobile

-mobile nav li's onto two lines sometimes
-top margins on mobile nav could be better
-on tiny mobile nav the hamburger menu and margins in general should be less (so content is wider)
tiny mobile nav, Liz menu is too much to left

-return all colours to normal
-edit globe continents and edit speech image colours

-image on about page could be wider on mobile
-check all fonts are nice, especially main title logo font
-change two columns to multiple columns of at least 3-4?
-make short text row (1-3 lines) and (4+ lines text row) or swap to using Foundation 6 grid?
-fix hyperlinks showing as white
-fix gaps when headings aren't chosen to be filled in
-fix footer on some pages ( actually only an issue when not enough content so should be ok)
-google analytics
-404 page
-contact thanks page has contact form on for some reason 
-FAVICON doesn't work - Charlotte's does - currently still drupal (in browser back button dropdown)
-google preview
-iphone issues: LIZ DEAN navbar text goes onto two lines




DONE:
-htc access - for redirects e.g. about to about/liz
-for a news section, I at the moment only have one entry template
-there is an issue with the 4 image boxes on home page where the fourth one drops down low when page is certain widths
-remove body section from homepage or make it slimmer
-add proper contact form?
-replace placeholder text
-Final li of mobile nav needs same margin as rest
- mobile nav is salmon, desktop is plain red:
nav {
    position: fixed;
    top: 0px;
    bottom: 0px;
    left: 0px;
    width: 260px;
    max-height: none;
    background-color: #C8233F;
    padding: 20px 15px;
    border-right: 4px;
    border-color: white;
    border-style: double;
    border-left: none;
    border-top: none;

}
- sending an email goes to 404 because there is no page http://www.lizdeanconsultancy.co.uk/index.php/contact/thanks
- urls are too long for mobile, not wrapping
-centering main nav title
- closing x is not in viewport, but to the right
