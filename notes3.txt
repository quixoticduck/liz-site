NOTES:

IDEAS:
- Try adding class for float left e.g. Liz' photo on about page
- try using textboxes for important/main info/blockquote
- bigger /different sized headings, break up the page (change red/blue to in textbox/not)
- sort out image transforms in Craft - only available inserting an image into rich text?
- make Liz image square?
- make liz image float left on large screens or position to left outside with posotion abosolute? (Haha yeah so the text box would also need a left margin as wide as the image or more.

Looks like it's absolute to the browser not the parent. So the parent prob still needs to be relative)

Double check:
- contact form
- on iphone 5 is the screen is scrollable left to right? needs max width on mobile?

TO DO !important:
- check google analystics tracking
- Make sure all pages are long enough MAINLY CONTACT THANKS AND 404 PAGE
- change wording of textbox summary in cms and code - old name makes little semantic sense now
- mobile margins are lopsided on my phone / - on tiny mobile there should be less padding (so content is wider) / - tried to make phone size text less wide but now not enough side padding on big screens
- mobile nav li's onto two lines on iphone 5
- around width 1160 the navbar text is set to shrink quite small for such a size. add another breakpoint?
- row number error for multiple columns  - textRowNo is still 'rowNumber' in some html docs  = causes error
- FAVICON doesn't work - Charlotte's does - currently still drupal (in browser back button dropdown)

TO REMOVE/FIX - not important:
- seperate responsive image field - does it work,. should i remove it?
- remove tags?
- all files go in images section in the cms and in the folders

TO DO not important:
- edit globe continents and edit speech image colours
- image on about page could be wider on mobile
- check all fonts are nice, especially main title logo font
- change two columns to multiple columns of at least 3-4?
- make short text row (1-3 lines) and (4+ lines text row) or swap to using Foundation 6 grid?
- fix footer on some pages ( actually only an issue when not enough content so should be ok)
- google analytics - php option - is working?
- 404 page
- google preview


DONE:
- htc access - for redirects e.g. about to about/liz
- for a news section, I at the moment only have one entry template
- there is an issue with the 4 image boxes on home page where the fourth one drops down low when page is certain widths
- remove body section from homepage or make it slimmer
- add proper contact form?
- replace placeholder text
- fix hyperlinks showing as white
- Final li of mobile nav needs same margin as rest
- tiny mobile nav, Liz menu is too much to left
- top margins on mobile nav could be better
- return all colours to normal
- mobile nav is salmon, desktop is plain red:
- in about page the text does not start high enough
- sending an email goes to 404 because there is no page http://www.lizdeanconsultancy.co.uk/index.php/contact/thanks
- urls are too long for mobile, not wrapping
- centering main nav title
- closing x is not in viewport, but to the right
- iphone issues: LIZ DEAN navbar text goes onto two lines
- contact form send button is not white
- contact thanks page has contact form on for some reason 
- OBSELETE fix gaps when headings aren't chosen to be filled in
- remove http://localhost:8888/contact/thanks from showing
- add the shadow to the navbar
- WEBSITE CURRENTLY UNDER RECONSTRUCTION heading etc should not be a link
- Try attaching a document such as a PDF
- divider margin? in index page? what does it do
- row number in multiple block layout does nothing. so remove it?
- color option in multiple block layout
- should I make multiple images a pair by default?
- solo  images don't show up in CMS such as in cms at bottom of homepage there should be a heart test
- add in a 'introductary paragraph' section in the cms (which is in a textbox) TEXT PARAGRAPHS STYLING IS CONFLICTING E.G. YOUTH WORK PAGE isn't in textbox
- decide on design conventions e.g. when textboxes are used, when headings
- multiple columns - header situation if none is input?
- add new if statements to all pages
- fix white text on youthwork page

nav {
    position: fixed;
    top: 0px;
    bottom: 0px;
    left: 0px;
    width: 260px;
    max-height: none;
    background-color: #C8233F;
    padding: 20px 15px;
    border-right: 4px;
