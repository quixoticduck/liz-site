Inserting images. Square?

And text wrap for images doesn't have border? E. G. For health page with pdf file link.

Possible 3 blocks per row option?

Combine paired block and double row text as right now there's now way to have non textbox text in a paired block? and non-textbox image in paired block

Can an image link to a pdf file without having to upload the pdf file as a link?

delete pdf insertion from fields and all templates

update the critical craft update

currently any uls without   ul {list-style: none; are showing as vertical lines due to grid: overflow hidden (was caused by not havign card-item in template
new issue: gaps on health page that are caused by grid as weren't in original
