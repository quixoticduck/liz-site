(1 day course)<\\/strong><br>&nbsp;<br>Rationale<br>Increasingly practitioners working with young people are becoming aware that their alcohol use has direct links with their sexual activity. As well as enabling easier interaction on a social level alcohol use lowers inhibitions and sometimes causes young people to do things they would not do had they not been drinking. Regret features largely in young peoples description of sexual activity when they have been drinking. This course aims to look at young peoples alcohol consumption, risk taking, and how this is affected by alcohol, and the sexual activity that ensues. It also aims to support practitioners formulate strategies and interventions to work with young people around these issues.<br>&nbsp;<br>Aim The purpose of this course is to enhance participants understanding of key issues and links between sexual activity and alcohol use, to increase their confidence in addressing these issues with young people.<br>&nbsp;<br>Learning Outcomes<br>At the end of this course, participants will have:<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an understanding of current research and resources around young peoples sexual activity and alcohol use.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; increased awareness of the links between alcohol use and sexual activity<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; explored values and attitudes towards risk taking behaviour<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gained practical tools to support their work with young people around alcohol use and sexual activity<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><br><strong class=\\\"redactor-inline-converted\\\">Course 3 R U Ready?

(1 day course)<\\/strong><br>&nbsp;<br>Rationale<br>Increasingly practitioners working with young people are becoming aware that their alcohol use has direct links with their sexual activity. As well as enabling easier interaction on a social level alcohol use lowers inhibitions and sometimes causes young people to do things they would not do had they not been drinking. Regret features largely in young peoples description of sexual activity when they have been drinking. This course aims to look at young peoples alcohol consumption, risk taking, and how this is affected by alcohol, and the sexual activity that ensues. It also aims to support practitioners formulate strategies and interventions to work with young people around these issues.<br>&nbsp;<br>Aim The purpose of this course is to enhance participants understanding of key issues and links between sexual activity and alcohol use, to increase their confidence in addressing these issues with young people.<br>&nbsp;<br>Learning Outcomes<br>At the end of this course, participants will have:<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an understanding of current research and resources around young peoples sexual activity and alcohol use.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; increased awareness of the links between alcohol use and sexual activity<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; explored values and attitudes towards risk taking behaviour<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gained practical tools to support their work with young people around alcohol use and sexual activity<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><br><strong class=\\\"redactor-inline-converted\\\">Course 3 R U Ready? Supporting Young People to consider their readiness for sexual relationships<\\/strong><br>&nbsp;<br>Rationale Many young people continue to report high levels of regret associated with their first sexual experiences. The earlier young people have sex means they are less likely to be engaging in consensual sex and less likely to practice safer sex leaving them emotionally vulnerable and at risk of STIs or an unplanned pregnancy.<br>&nbsp;<br>Aim This course will explore the issues and pressures on young people to become sexually active and enable practitioners to be more confident in offering young people practical skills and strategies to delay sex until they are ready.

(1 day course)<\\/strong><br>&nbsp;<br>Rationale<br>Increasingly practitioners working with young people are becoming aware that their alcohol use has direct links with their sexual activity. As well as enabling easier interaction on a social level alcohol use lowers inhibitions and sometimes causes young people to do things they would not do had they not been drinking. Regret features largely in young peoples description of sexual activity when they have been drinking. This course aims to look at young peoples alcohol consumption, risk taking, and how this is affected by alcohol, and the sexual activity that ensues. It also aims to support practitioners formulate strategies and interventions to work with young people around these issues.<br>&nbsp;<br>Aim The purpose of this course is to enhance participants understanding of key issues and links between sexual activity and alcohol use, to increase their confidence in addressing these issues with young people.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Learning Outcomes<\\/strong><br>At the end of this course, participants will have:<br><\\/p><ul><li>an understanding of current research and resources around young peoples sexual activity and alcohol use.increased awareness of the links between alcohol use and sexual activity<\\/li><li>explored values and attitudes towards risk taking behaviour<\\/li><li>gained practical tools to support their work with young people around alcohol use and sexual activity<\\/li><\\/ul><p><br><strong class=\\\"redactor-inline-converted\\\">Course 3 R U Ready? Supporting Young People to consider their readiness for sexual relationships<\\/strong><br>&nbsp;<br>Rationale Many young people continue to report high levels of regret associated with their first sexual experiences. The earlier young people have sex means they are less likely to be engaging in consensual sex and less likely to practice safer sex leaving them emotionally vulnerable and at risk of STIs or an unplanned pregnancy.<br>&nbsp;<br>Aim This course will explore the issues and pressures on young people to become sexually active and enable practitioners to be more confident in offering young people practical skills and strategies to delay sex until they are ready. These principles apply not only to first sex but to ongoing new sexual relationships.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong class=\\\"redactor-inline-converted\\\">Learning Outcomes<\\/strong><\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>At the end of this course, participants will;<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Have a greater awareness on the issues and pressures on young people to become sexually active and the reasons why early sex happens<br>Understand why early sex is a problem<br>Gain confidence and practical strategies to help & support young people delay sex & be more assertive in saying no to unwanted sex<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><em><strong class=\\\"redactor-inline-converted\\\">Overview:<\\/strong><\\/em><\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><em>current youth worker role (link to the youth collective website).&nbsp;<\\/em><\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><em>What I can offer \\u2013 one off sessions, a series of sessions \\/ workshops, 1-1 work; youth worker training. \\u2013<\\/em><\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><em>overview of the current programme delivered for BH.&nbsp;<\\/em><\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><em>Link to IYW. <\\/em><\\/p>\",\"myBlockUrl\":\"\",\"tags\":\"\"}}}}}', '2016-05-02 03:06:07', '2016-05-02 03:06:07', '647ce948-f447-41a1-b951-a6664bad42d9'),

(1 day course)<\\/strong><br>&nbsp;<br>Rationale<br>Increasingly practitioners working with young people are becoming aware that their alcohol use has direct links with their sexual activity. As well as enabling easier interaction on a social level alcohol use lowers inhibitions and sometimes causes young people to do things they would not do had they not been drinking. Regret features largely in young peoples description of sexual activity when they have been drinking. This course aims to look at young peoples alcohol consumption, risk taking, and how this is affected by alcohol, and the sexual activity that ensues. It also aims to support practitioners formulate strategies and interventions to work with young people around these issues.<br>&nbsp;<br>Aim The purpose of this course is to enhance participants understanding of key issues and links between sexual activity and alcohol use, to increase their confidence in addressing these issues with young people.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Learning Outcomes<\\/strong><br>At the end of this course, participants will have:<br><\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul><li>an understanding of current research and resources around young peoples sexual activity and alcohol use.increased awareness of the links between alcohol use and sexual activity<\\/li><li>explored values and attitudes towards risk taking behaviour<\\/li><li>gained practical tools to support their work with young people around alcohol use and sexual activity<\\/li><\\/ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><br><strong class=\\\"redactor-inline-converted\\\">Course 3 R U Ready? Supporting Young People to consider their readiness for sexual relationships<\\/strong><br>&nbsp;<br>Rationale Many young people continue to report high levels of regret associated with their first sexual experiences.

As well as enabling easier interaction on a social level alcohol use lowers inhibitions and sometimes causes young people to do things they would not do had they not been drinking. Regret features largely in young peoples description of sexual activity when they have been drinking. This course aims to look at young peoples alcohol consumption, risk taking, and how this is affected by alcohol, and the sexual activity that ensues.

(1 day course)<\\/strong><br>&nbsp;<br>Rationale Increasingly practitioners working with young people are becoming aware that their alcohol use has direct links with their sexual activity. As well as enabling easier interaction on a social level alcohol use lowers inhibitions and sometimes causes young people to do things they would not do had they not been drinking. Regret features largely in young peoples description of sexual activity when they have been drinking. This course aims to look at young peoples alcohol consumption, risk taking, and how this is affected by alcohol, and the sexual activity that ensues. It also aims to support practitioners formulate strategies and interventions to work with young people around these issues.<br>&nbsp;<br>Aim<br> The purpose of this course is to enhance participants understanding of key issues and links between sexual activity and alcohol use, to increase their confidence in addressing these issues with young people.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Learning Outcomes<\\/strong><br>At the end of this course, participants will have:<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul><li>an understanding of current research and resources around young \\r\\npeoples sexual activity and alcohol use.increased awareness of the links\\r\\n between alcohol use and sexual activity<\\/li><li>explored values and attitudes towards risk taking behaviour<\\/li><li>gained practical tools to support their work with young people around alcohol use and sexual activity<\\/li><\\/ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Course 3 R U Ready?

These principles apply not only to first sex but to ongoing new sexual relationships.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Learning Outcomes<\\/strong><\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>At the end of this course, participants will;<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Have a greater awareness on the issues and pressures on young people to become sexually active and the reasons why early sex happens<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Understand why early sex is a problem<br>Gain confidence and practical strategies to help & support young people delay sex & be more assertive in saying no to unwanted sex<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><em><strong>Overview:<\\/strong><\\/em><\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><em>current youth worker role (link to the youth collective website).&nbsp;<\\/em><\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><em>What I can offer \\u2013 one off sessions, a series of sessions \\/ workshops, 1-1 work; youth worker training. \\u2013<\\/em><\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><em>overview of the current programme delivered for BH.&nbsp;<\\/em><\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><em>Link to IYW. <\\/em><\\/p>\",\"tags\":\"\"}}}}}', '2016-10-05 04:57:51', '2016-10-05 04:57:51', '52b023eb-f6a2-4f26-8406-26f526a6ad10'),

These principles apply not only to first sex but to ongoing new sexual relationships.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Learning Outcomes<\\/strong><\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>At the end of this course, participants will;<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Have a greater awareness on the issues and pressures on young people to become sexually active and the reasons why early sex happens<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Understand why early sex is a problem<br>Gain confidence and practical strategies to help & support young people delay sex & be more assertive in saying no to unwanted sex<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><em><strong>Overview:<\\/strong><\\/em><\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><em>current youth worker role (link to the youth collective website).&nbsp;<\\/em><\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><em>What I can offer \\u2013 one off sessions, a series of sessions \\/ workshops, 1-1 work; youth worker training. \\u2013<\\/em><\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><em>overview of the current programme delivered for BH.&nbsp;<\\/em><\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><em>Link to IYW. <\\/em><\\/p>\",\"tags\":\"\"}}}}}', '2016-10-05 04:59:18', '2016-10-05 04:59:18', '5c63907a-8d95-452e-811f-a6c3a143b3b5'),

As well as enabling easier interaction on a social level alcohol use lowers inhibitions and sometimes causes young people to do things they would not do had they not been drinking. Regret features largely in young peoples description of sexual activity when they have been drinking.

(1 day course)<\\/strong><br>&nbsp;<br>Rationale Increasingly practitioners working with young people are becoming aware that their alcohol use has direct links with their sexual activity. As well as enabling easier interaction on a social level alcohol use lowers inhibitions and sometimes causes young people to do things they would not do had they not been drinking. Regret features largely in young peoples description of sexual activity when they have been drinking. This course aims to look at young peoples alcohol consumption, risk taking, and how this is affected by alcohol, and the sexual activity that ensues. It also aims to support practitioners formulate strategies and interventions to work with young people around these issues.<br>&nbsp;<br>Aim<br> The purpose of this course is to enhance participants understanding of key issues and links between sexual activity and alcohol use, to increase their confidence in addressing these issues with young people.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Learning Outcomes<\\/strong><br>At the end of this course, participants will have:<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul><li>an understanding of current research and resources around young \\r\\npeoples sexual activity and alcohol use.increased awareness of the links\\r\\n between alcohol use and sexual activity<\\/li><li>explored values and attitudes towards risk taking behaviour<\\/li><li>gained practical tools to support their work with young people around alcohol use and sexual activity<\\/li><\\/ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Course 3 R U Ready? Supporting Young People to consider their readiness for sexual relationships<\\/strong><br>&nbsp;<br>Rationale<br> Many young people continue to report high levels of regret associated with their first sexual experiences. The earlier young people have sex means they are less likely to be engaging in consensual sex and less likely to practice safer sex leaving them emotionally vulnerable and at risk of STIs or an unplanned pregnancy.<br>&nbsp;<br>Aim This course will <br>explore the issues and pressures on young people to become sexually active and enable practitioners to be more confident in offering young people practical skills and strategies to delay sex until they are ready.

As well as enabling easier interaction on a social level alcohol use lowers inhibitions and sometimes causes young people to do things they would not do had they not been drinking. Regret features largely in young peoples description of sexual activity when they have been drinking. This course aims to look at young peoples alcohol consumption, risk taking, and how this is affected by alcohol, and the sexual activity that ensues.
